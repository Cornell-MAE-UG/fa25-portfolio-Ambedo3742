<h3> Introduction </h3>
As part of a class project, our group conducted an analysis on the performance of a brazed plate heat exchanger when used with heated and chilled water. In the image below, the heat exchanger is set to operate in a counter-flow configuration. We also took measurements regarding a parallel flow configuration.
