## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}
 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering student at Cornell University. I am passionate about improving the breadth and depth of my knowledge, both within engineering and without. 

In my own time, I enjoy making my life easier, be that through physical and mental organizational systems, exploring new tools, or designing my own.
